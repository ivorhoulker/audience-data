Some screenshots of the firebase database so you can understand its structure.

Understand that firebase is a NoSQL document database, but I'm using autogenerated uuids basically like foreign keys in sql.

Each user (even anonymous) gets an automatic uuid associated when they go to the site. This is cached and persistent. That is used to identify their answers in /answers.

Questions each have a uuid that is used to identify what the answers are in response to.

### So `/answers` looks like

```js
userId: {
  questionId: answerValue;
}
```

### `/users`

```js
userId: {
  name: nameValue;
}
```

### `/questions`

```js
questionId: {
  category: catValue
  ...etc
}
```
